Implmentation:
------------
* Gene code:

* Gene expression:

* Select function:
  Select individuals with the highest fitness in the generation and copy them directly to the child generation. And those good individuals are also used to generate children.
* Evolution:
  It include crossover and mutation. <br>
  For crossover, we generate a random number and the child's chromosome is part chromosome od father plus part chromosme of mother according to the random number.<br>
  For mutation, we swap two cities which are chosen randomly.
