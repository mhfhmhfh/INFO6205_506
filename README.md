Implmentation:
------------
* Gene code:

* Gene expression:

* Fitness function:
  
* Evolution:
  It include crossover and mutation. <br>
  For crossover, we generate a random number and the child's chromosome is part chromosome od father plus part chromosme of mother according to the random number.
  For mutation, we generate a random number and if the number less to the mutation factor, we swap two cities which are chosen randomly.

Detailed information is in our report.
